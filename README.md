# Component Importer

![](https://placehold.it/600x300)

The `component-importer` is a command line tool that makes it easy to import TypeScript based React design systems into Framer X.

## Why Design Systems?

Design Systems lower engineering costs by keeping a single source of truth for your company's visual language. Recognized as valuable tools, design systems have been successfully adopted by the industry's most sophisticated players like [Google](https://material.io/design/), [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/) and [Uber](https://baseweb.design/). Even the [UK](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) and [US](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) government have one!

There's still one big problem though: production design systems are typically only accesible to technical designers, comfortable enough with the command line and familiar with web development tooling like Webpack, Typescript/Flow, React/Angular, etc. This means that designers often end up having to maintain their own copy which is expensive to keep in sync.

## The Component Importer: bridging the gap between design and engineering

The `component-importer` is a command line tool that analyzes your production design system's source code and generates readable React components that can be loaded by visual design and prototyping tools like [Framer X](https://framer.com). Let's take a look at the generated code:

```ts
import * as React from "react" // <=== Section 1
import * as BaseUi from "baseui/button"
import { addPropertyControls, ControlType } from "framer"

function Button(props) {
	return <BaseUi.Button {...props} />
}

addPropertyControls(Button, { // <=== Section 2
	kind: { type: ControlType.Enum, defaultValue: "primary" },
	label: { type: ControlType.String },
	isLoading: { type: ControlType.Boolean, defaultValue: false },
})
```

If you work with react you will quickly understand Sections 1: we're importing the `Button` component from the `baseui` NPM package, and wrapping it in a function.

The real interesting part is in Section 2. By analyzing the button component's source code, we generate [property controls](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/) for the button. This means you can now drag your button to the canvas and modify it using a GUI that everyone can understand:

## The Goal: Increasing Design System Adoption

As a design system maintainer, your design system's value is proportional to its adoption. To be successful you'll need to think beyond just developing components, but also about making sure that they are well documented and intuitive for everyone involved in the process - this can range from designers and engineers to product managers and content creators. The `component-importer` tries to lower the barrier of adoption by making your design system instantly available.

## Getting Started

To install run `yarn global add @framerjs/component-importer`. This will globally install the `component-importer` executable.

### Example: Importing the [grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) design system

Let's go through the process of importing the grommet design system from scratch.

### **Step 1**: Project Setup

Create a Framer X [folder backed project](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer-x/folder-backed-projects/):

 - Create a new Framer X project
 - Hold Option and click File â€º Save As
 - In the save dialog, click the File Format dropdown and select "Framer X (Folder)"
 - Click Save

**NOTE**: `.framerfx` projects are regular NPM projects. Go to your favorite text editor and try to open the folder we just created. The contents should look something like this:

```
build/
code/
design/
metadata/
node_modules/
package.json
README.md
tsconfig.json
yarn.lock
```

As you can see, it's a good ol' NPM package with its `package.json` and `node_modules`. It also has a `tsconfig.json` file as Framer X supports TypeScript by default.

### **Step 2**: Add Dependencies

Before we import grommet, we will first need to install grommet and its peer dependencies:

```bash
# cd into the project created in the previous step.
cd ~/my-project.framerfx

# Add grommet and styled-components, since it's a peerDependency of grommet
yarn add grommet styled-components
```

### **Step 3**: Run the component-importer

In order to configure the component importer you will need to setup a configuration file, usually at the root of your project.

The `component-importer init` command will help you setup the appropriate defaults for your project.

The general syntax is `component importer init <packageName>`, an example being `component-importer init @blueprintjs/core` which will attempt to import the `@blueprintjs/core` package into your Framer X project.

Now you can run the following command for your design system of choice:

```bash
component-importer init grommet
```
